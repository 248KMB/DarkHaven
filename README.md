# Project Title

## Introduction
Welcome to my project page for **DarkHaven**. Dark Haven is a 3D RPG(role-playing game) that consists of a warrior who needs to kill all the mobs in a cave. I joined a team of 5 in pushing our game design careers with our first-ever game.

## Detailed Description
Our project is inspired by popular video games like Diablo, Monster Hunter, and Dark Souls. We aim to capture the engaging world and combat mechanics of Monster Hunter, where you can use various weapons and experience dynamic gameplay. We aim to recreate the excitement we felt when first playing these games, from the detailed world-building to the enjoyable gameplay. To achieve this, we've added unique elements, including a fluid combat system, a carefully crafted world viewed from a top-down perspective, and a dark atmosphere that enhances the overall experience.
As you step into the role of the Hunter, your mission is clear: you're a Bounty Hunter from the respected Hunters Guild, tasked with eliminating the monstrous threat in Dark Haven. Along your journey, you'll encounter enemies, such as skeletons, spiders, ogres, and a dragon, each with unique attack patterns. Your valued skills and growth as a Hunter will determine whether or not youâ€™ll be able to succeed in conquering the dungeon of Dark Haven. 

**Key Objectives:**
- Objective 1: Enter the dungeon 
- Objective 2: Slaughter all mobs 
- Objective 3: Reach the final boss 

## Role and Contributions
In this project, I served as the lead game designer, level designer, and narrative designer. My primary responsibilities included:
- Task 1: Creating the storyline 
- Task 2: Designing the levels 
- Task 3: Mob implementation 

## Key Features
**Dark Haven** boasts several unique features:
- **Unique Combat Mechanics:** The game boasts a sophisticated combat system with detailed health and damage tracking for players and mobs. This system ensures dynamic interactions and challenges, allowing for a varied and engaging combat experience.

- **Aggression System:** Utilizing an advanced radius sensor, the game features an aggression mechanism where mobs react to the player's proximity. If a player ventures too close, the mobs will actively pursue, adding an element of strategy and tension to the gameplay.
   
- **Unity Asset Support for Fighting Animation:** Leveraging the rich library of Unity assets, Dark Haven incorporates high-quality fighting animations. This enhances combat's visual appeal and fluidity, providing a visually compelling and satisfying experience for players and mobs.

## Technologies Used
The development of this game utilized the following technologies:
- **Game Engine:** Unity 
- **Programming Languages:** C#
- **Other Tools:** Github 

## Media {IN PROGRESS]

## Development Process
### Planning
The planning phase first involved the story. As the team leader, I gathered input from all team members to shape the game's narrative. We devised an engaging plot centered around a warrior desperate for money. This warrior approaches a guild and learns of a mission to clear out a dangerous cave, setting the primary goal for the player. This led me to make two distinct scenes: the home and the levels scenes. 

### Design
#### Environmental Design  
**Terrain**: Use the grass, rocks, and tree assets to create varied landscapes. Use Unity's Terrain tools to sculpt hills, valleys, and other natural features.

**Structures**: Place cabins and camps strategically to serve as checkpoints, quest locations, or enemy bases. Ensure these structures have logical placements in relation to the terrain (e.g., cabins near woods).

**Gate**: The gate can be a significant feature, as an entry to the fortified cave.

#### Level Design
**Flags**: Place flags to illustrate controlled areas.

**Barrels and Crates**: Use for environmental storytelling elements.
Torches: Position torches to further improve the experience of the cave.

#### Character Design 
- **Knight Design**: Ensure the knight's armor and weapons are period-appropriate.
- 
- **Animations**: Leverage the animation package for smooth combat, idle, walking, and running animations.

### Implementation
The implementation phase included [describe coding, asset creation, integration].

### Testing
We conducted extensive testing, focusing on [describe testing methods, feedback collection, bug fixing].
