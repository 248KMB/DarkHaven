I entered a group of 4 people to work together in creating an RPG 3D game using unity. The RPG game is a thrid person 
survival leveling game where the player needs to eliminate all the mobs in the dungeon to win the game. I used unity assests for designing the environment of all areas of the game and did a few input systems 
for movements of the character.
