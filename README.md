I entered a group of 4 people to work together in creating an RPG 3D game using Unity. This RPG game 'DarkHaven' is a third-person 
survival leveling game where the player needs to eliminate all the mobs in the dungeon to win the game. I used Unity assets for designing the environment of all game areas and did a few input systems for the movements of the character.
